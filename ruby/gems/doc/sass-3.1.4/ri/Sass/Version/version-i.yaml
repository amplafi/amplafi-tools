    body: "Returns a hash representing the version of Sass. The `:major`, `:minor`, and `:teeny` keys have their respective numbers as Fixnums. The `:name` key has the name of the version. The `:string` key contains a human-readable string representation of the version. The `:number` key is the major, minor, and teeny keys separated by periods. If Sass is checked out from Git, the `:rev` key will have the revision hash. For example:"

A `:prerelease` key will contain the name of the prerelease (e.g. `&quot;beta&quot;`), and a `:prerelease_number` key will contain the rerelease number. For example:"
