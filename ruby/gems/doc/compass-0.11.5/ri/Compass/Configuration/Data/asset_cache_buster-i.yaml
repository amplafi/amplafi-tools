    body: When called with a block, defines the cache buster strategy to be used. If the block returns nil or a string, then it is appended to the url as a query parameter. In this case, the returned string must not include the starting '?'. The block may also return a hash with :path and/or :query values and it will replace the original path and query string with the busted values returned. The block will be passed the root-relative url of the asset. If the block accepts two arguments, it will also be passed a File object that points to the asset on disk -- which may or may not exist. When called without a block, returns the block that was previously set.
