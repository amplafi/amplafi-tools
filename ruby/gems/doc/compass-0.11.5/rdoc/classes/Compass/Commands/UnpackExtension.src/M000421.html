           |
           | Unpacking an extension is useful when you need to easily peruse the
           | extension's source. You might find yourself tempted to change the
           | stylesheets here. If you do this, you'll find it harder to take
           | updates from the original author. Sometimes this seems like a good
           | idea at the time, but in a few months, you'll probably regret it.
           |
           | In the future, if you take an update of this framework, you'll need to run
           |
           |     compass unpack #{framework.name}
           |
           | again or remove this unpacked extension.
