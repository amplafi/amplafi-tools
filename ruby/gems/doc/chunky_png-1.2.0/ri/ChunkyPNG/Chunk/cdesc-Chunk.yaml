    body: A PNG datastream consists of multiple chunks. This module, and the classes contained within, help with handling these chunks. It supports both reading and writing chunks.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: All chunk types are instances of the {ChunkyPNG::Chunk::Base} class. For some chunk types a specialized class is available, e.g. the IHDR chunk is represented by the {ChunkyPNG::Chunk::Header} class. These specialized classes help accessing the content of the chunk. All other chunks are represented by the {ChunkyPNG::Chunk::Generic} class.
