  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Adam7 interlacing extracts 7 pass images out of a single image, that can be encoded to a stream separately so the image can be built up progressively. The module is included into ChunkyPNG canvas and is used to extract the pass images from the original image, or to reconstruct an original image from separate pass images.
